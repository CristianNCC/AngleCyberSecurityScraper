Inevitably, a friend will log off with something in their inventory that you needed. You can pilfer what they held out on you by checking what looks like a dresser inside their cabin. If you choose to invite friends to one of your existing saves, they will create a new character and begin with a basic set of tools, no skill levels, and only the starting amount of daily energy. My partner was forced to dig through my abandoned clothes and weapons to find hand-me-downs that would let him dive into the lowest levels of the mines, while also finding that he didn’t have the energy to water all the crops on my farm. 

Apart from time constraints, a few other oddities are worth noting. While in multiplayer mode, you will not be able to move or demolish your farm buildings from Robin’s store. Presumably this could create conflicts if your friends are inside of a building you demolish or are standing where you hope to move one. For a constant organizer like me, kicking my partner out so I could edit our farm’s arrangement in singleplayer every so often is not ideal.

Once your multiplayer farm is running like clockwork, you can expand your operation into the modded zone with the multiplayer mods linked above!
